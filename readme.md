Regular Updates
===============

A Drupal 7 module for sending site-event updates to external targets.

The idea is that it will be able to select the interval, the kind of events and the targets (Email, JSON api, etc.)

Under development.

##Todo

- Short array syntax should not be used in Drupal 7.x.

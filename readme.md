Regular Updates
===============

A Drupal 7 module for sending site-event updates to external targets.

The idea is that it will be able to select the interval, the kind of events and the targets (Email, JSON api, etc.)

Under development.

##Todo

- Make forum log functionality
- Make it possible for user to definecustom email template files in the theme folder
- What if the user has set the cron to run only before the selected trigger time?
- Get UID of new accounts
- Also log other user events (such as cancelation of account)
- Make a kickass default emaiil template
- Test email from a live domain that can send emails.
